      <description>This post is highlight the speed benefit of CRAM files over BAM files as it seems to not be widely used.
CRAM files are often about 50% of the size of an identical BAM for lossless compression largely due to not saving the sequence of each read, instead keeping only the delta to the reference sequence for the alignment. Additional savings can be gained from lossy compression of base-qualities and read-names.</description>
