      <description>hts-nim is a library that allows one to use htslib via the nim programming language. Nim is a garbage-collected language that compiles to C and often has similar performance. I have become very productive in nim and especially in hts-nim and there are by now, at least a few other users of hts-nim. This post is to show how one particular feature of nim enables users to write their own functions that will be used no differently than hts-nim&amp;rsquo;s provided functionality.</description>
