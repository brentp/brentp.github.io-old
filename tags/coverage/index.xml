      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a new project and part of it is made possible by an observation that we stumbled on with mosdepth. It&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s obvious in retrospect but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully apparent to me until after mosdepth was mostly written. In short, that observation is computers can do stuff with arrays quickly.
The longer story behind that obvious and simple observation is as follows. mosdepth is a tool to calculate depth from BAM/CRAM files.</description>
