      <description>This post is to introduce indexcov and answer common question I get about interpretation.
I have found that, as indexcov is applied to cohorts approaching size of 100 or so, the probability that it will reveal something very interesting (either a data artefact or large chromosomal anomaly) approaches 1.0. For example, who knew that there were trisomies in Simons diversity panel?
indexcov quickly estimates coverage for whole genome BAM and CRAM files.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a new project and part of it is made possible by an observation that we stumbled on with mosdepth. It&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s obvious in retrospect but wasn&amp;rsquo;t fully apparent to me until after mosdepth was mostly written. In short, that observation is computers can do stuff with arrays quickly.
The longer story behind that obvious and simple observation is as follows. mosdepth is a tool to calculate depth from BAM/CRAM files.</description>
