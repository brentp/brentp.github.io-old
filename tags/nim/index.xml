      <description>I stumbled on this (now) obvious way of doing things that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen used much/at all; In a project soon to be released, we needed to quickly assay thousands of sites from BAM/CRAM files and do a sort of cheap genotyping&amp;ndash;or allele counting. Given this task, a common tool to reach for is the pile-up.
Pile-up is pretty fast but it has to do a lot of work. Even to assay a single site, a pileup will first get each read and a pileup structure (bam_pileup1_t in htslib) for each read into memory.</description>
