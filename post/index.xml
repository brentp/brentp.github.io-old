      <description>A while ago I had an idea to find variants on the X chromosome that are under recessive constraint&amp;ndash;that is that they appear in some non-zero frequency in females but never occur in male. That is, without an extra copy, a variant might be embryonic lethal in males, but could be seen in females thanks to a backup copy. I though that these might be occurring at a relatively high allele frequency (1 in 1000).</description>
